## 📊 Evaluation Philosophy

**Classification Metrics Priority:**
1. **Business Context First** → Choose metrics aligned with costs of errors
2. **Confusion Matrix** → Understand FP vs FN trade-offs
3. **Precision-Recall Curves** → For imbalanced datasets
4. **ROC-AUC** → Overall discriminative ability

**Regression Metrics Toolkit:**
- **MAE** → Absolute error magnitude
- **RMSE** → Penalizes larger errors
- **R² Score** → Variance explained
- **MAPE** → Percentage-based interpretability

**Clustering Validation:**
- **Silhouette Score** → Cohesion vs separation
- **Davies-Bouldin Index** → Intra-cluster similarity
- **Elbow Method** → Optimal cluster count
