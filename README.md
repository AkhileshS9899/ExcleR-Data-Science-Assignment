🚀 Data Science Assignments – ExcelR
















Welcome to my Data Science Assignments Repository!
This repository contains practical assignments, case studies, and mini-projects completed during my Data Science course at ExcelR. Each section highlights my ability to apply concepts in real-world scenarios, covering everything from data preprocessing to advanced machine learning techniques.

🌟 About Data Science

Data Science is the art and science of extracting valuable insights from data by combining:

📊 Statistics & Probability → Understanding patterns & trends

🤖 Machine Learning → Building predictive & intelligent models

🛠 Programming & Tools → Implementing scalable solutions

📈 Data Visualization → Communicating insights effectively

Today, Data Science empowers industries like healthcare, finance, e-commerce, supply chain, and technology by driving data-informed decisions.
